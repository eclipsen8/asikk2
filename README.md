# Custom Data Structures in Java

This project is a manual implementation of common data structures in Java without using `java.util.*`, except for Iterator.

## Implemented Structures

- MyList<T> — Custom interface for list operations
- MyArrayList<T> — Dynamic array implementation
- MyLinkedList<T> — Doubly linked list implementation
- MyStack<T> — Stack implementation based on MyLinkedList
- MyQueue<T> — Queue implementation based on MyLinkedList
- MyMinHeap — Min-heap (priority queue) implementation based on MyArrayList

## Technologies
- Java (No standard collection libraries)
- Git for version control
